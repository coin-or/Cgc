As Cgc (Coin Graph Classes) is a header-file-only template library, it
doesn't require building independent of your code.

To access the library, add an include path to your compile line.

As an example, for g++, this is something like: -I(basedir)/src   
where (basedir) is the directory where Cgc is installed.

To build the example:
cd examples
make

To run the examples:
simple
simpleShortestPath
pathFindExample
sspsolver

To build the unit tests:
cd test
make

To run the unit tests:
unitTest

On success of the unit tests, there should be a summary of all the tests run, 
and a final line:
PASSED
