<title> PathFind algorithm </title>
<body>
<H1> Purpose</H1>
<P>The purpose of the PathFind Algorithm class is to find an exhaustive list
of all paths between to distinct nodes (source and sink).  This document
identifies how it is accomplished and documents the test program.
<H1>PathFind construction </H1>
<p>The PathFind object's construction is completed by passing in arguments for
the GraphType (satisifies the template parameters), a reference to the 
graph, and identification of the source and sink within the graph.
<p>The constructor also takes care of a little maintenance.  It initializes
the list of active candidates to have the source node.
<H1>Algorithm</H1>
<P>The heart of this implementation is a Depth First Search with some 
modifications.  The modifications are centered around the identification of
stopping criteria within the recursion.  
<H1>Potential Improvements:</H1>
<P>
This could be improved by adding a topological ordering and hence a
reductions in nodes visited may be possible.  However, to me this seemed
a bit specific for this general implementation.
<P>
Also, the recursion could be unwound thus reducing the information stored on 
the stack.  
<P>
Another convenient enhancement would be to make this more like an iterator
where once initialized, a ++ operator would return a reference to the next
Path.  This could occur instead of the current "all or nothing" format.
