<title>Traversals</title>
<body>
<H1>Purpose</H1>
<P>The purpose of the graph traversal algorithms are two-fold.  
<li>First and foremost to give a reasonable wayto traverse the graphs.  </li>
<li>Second to show samples of how to traverse the graphs in different ways. </li>
<H1>Breadth First Traversal (BFTraversal)</H1>
<li>This iterates through the graph's nodes in a breadth first order. </li>
<H2>Algorithm</H1>
<P>This uses a queue to store child nodes.  They are processes in FIFO order.  
<p>Visit a node, putting it's children (if it has any) in the queue.
<p>Pop the front of the queue and process that node.  Continue until the queue is empty.
<H2>Potential Improvements:</H1>
<P>
Keep a side set to check for multiple visitation of the same node (cycle detection).
<P>
<H1>Depth First Traversal (DFTraversal)</H1>
<li>This iterates through the graph's nodes in a depth first order. </li>
<H2>Algorithm</H1>
<P>This uses a stack to store child nodes.  They are processes in LIFO order.  
<p>Visit a node, putting it's children (if it has any) in the stack.
<p>Pop the top of the queue and process that node.  Continue until the stack is empty.
