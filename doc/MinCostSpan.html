<title>Min Cost Spanning Tree</title>
<body>
<H1> Purpose</H1>
<P> The Min Cost Spanning Tree finds a tree of minimum cost 
<H1>Algorithm</H1>
<P>Initialize each node as it's own tree in a forest
<p>Sort the arcs in min-cost order.
<p>For each arc, attempt to add it.  If both ends of the arc have the same tree id, then don't add the arc.
<p>If the nodes have differing tree ids, then add the arc and merge the trees together.
<p>The heavy computation is the disjoint set union.
<H1>Potential Improvements:</H1>
<P>I think this one is about as good as it gets.<P>
