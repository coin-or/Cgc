<H1>Graph plans</H1>
<P>I have code for an undirected static graph.  However, it doesn't compile on the latest platform and is 
therefore considered experimental code.  It will be added in the near future.
<H1>Algorithms</H1>
<P>A few Max Flow solvers were working on an older compiler release.  It will be added in the near future.
These include Shortest Autmenting Path and GoldMF.
