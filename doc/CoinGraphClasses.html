<body>
<h1>Purpose of CoinGraphClasses</h1>
The purpose of the CoinGraphClasses collection of Network Representations and Algorithms
is to facilitate the development and implementation of Network Algorithms.
The library was designed with some key ideas in mind:
<h2>Key ideas</h2>
<li>Use STL and STL-like interfaces
<li>Allow for common iteration through the network containers regardless of representation
<li>Provide the ability to access the data structures named "nodes" and "arcs" for clarity
<li>Any Network representation should be able to survive more than one Algorithm
<li>Any Algorithm should be able to survive more than one Network Representation
<li>Make the representations as compact as possible without sacrificing speed or time complexity
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p> <B>node</B>:Often called a vertex, or point.  It is normally represented 
by a circle.  In a transportation Network, these might be locations or cities 
on a map
<p> <B>arc</B>:Often called an edge, or arrow.  It may be either directed or 
undirected.  The head is the destination, the tail is the origin.  The head 
and tail are Nodes that are at either end. In a transportation network, the Arcs
might be roads, or navigation channels in rivers, or aircraft flight patterns.
They supply connectivity between the Nodes.  A one-way street might be 
represented by a directed arc.  A two-way street might be an undirected arc or
by two directed arcs that point in opposite directions.
<p> <B>iterator</B>:An iterator provides a mechanism for accessing Nodes 
sequentially.  With STL, you can have a collection of ints in an array called:
vector < int > myVector.  An iterator to this collection would be declared 
vector < int > ::iterator ;
<p> <B>const_iterator</B>:A constant reference version of an iterator.  The
user cannot alter the value referred to by the iterator.
<p> <B>arc_iterator</B>: An arc_iterator allows the user to access arcs of the 
network sequentially.  The arcs may be accessed using two different means.  One
way is to sequentially access all the arcs in the network.  The other is to 
access all the arcs at one node.  Both have a common iterator type.  The only 
real difference is the test for the end of iteration.  If you want to iterate 
across a node's arcs, you use begin() and end() member functions of the node.  
If you wish to iterate through a network's arcs, you use the arc_begin() and
arc_end() member functions.
<p> <B>const_arc_iterator</B>: A constant reference version of an arc_iterator.
The user cannot alter the arc referred to by the iterator.
<p> <B>algorithm</B>:An algorithm is a series of steps that will accomplish a 
certain task with some (hopefully known) space and time complexity.  A solver 
using the CoinGraphClasses collections can be implemented similar to STL algorithms.  
This means that if you follow the common interface between different CoinGraphClasses
collections, then the algorithm can perform (maybe with different complexity)
on any appropriate CoinGraphClasses network with very little modification.  A 
demonstration is included to show how this might be accomplished.
<h1>C++ and the Standard C++ Library</h1>
<p>The introduction of STL into the C++ library will have significant 
impact on algorithm developers using C++.  With the advent of common 
containers and basic Computer Science 
algorithms as part of the standard, code (hence algorithms) may be shared more 
readily and used with data types that more difficult to use in the past.
<p>More information on STL is available either from books, or the web.  This will not assist
in teaching you STL.  However, if you are familiar with STL and C++, then you 
should find using CoinGraphClasses will be second nature.  
<h1>Network Containers</h1>
<p>There are some difficulties in building containers for Networks that do 
not arise with normal containers.  Normal containers have a single data 
type (or structure or class) 
that are collected together and maybe compared or sorted, etc.  In the case of a Network, there 
are two related/distinct types: Nodes and Arcs.  The Arcs refer to Nodes, but otherwise, they
are somewhat independent.
<p>In the implementation of Networks in CoinGraphClasses, every CoinGraphClasses container has a collection of Nodes.
The Nodes are containers for their outbound Arcs.  (In some implementations, there are
back-arcs too).  Also, there may be data on the Nodes and there may be data on the arcs.  
Unlike normal containers, this may be different data types.
<p>Maybe a simple example would help.  In a simple Shortest Path problem, there are locations
(nodes) and distances between them (represented by durations or distances on the arcs).  The 
goal is to find the shortest way between two locations using only the distances specified(arcs).  
Clearly, there must be some way of storing the duration/distance of the arc on the arc.  Also,
in most algorithms, there must be some way of storing information regarding the 'current 
status of a solution at the nodes.  
<p>Users of CoinGraphClasses containers must implement Node and Arc content classes for thier problem.
In the example above, the user may create a Miles and a NodeStatus for the Arc cost data and
the Node label data.  
<p>CoinGraphClasses provides template containers that are parameterized on the Node and Arc data implemented
by the user.  Once again following the example above, and assuming a Static Network is 
suitable, the user might create a CoinGraphClasses container using:
<p>
<i>typedef StaticNet< NodeStatus,Miles > MyNetType; MyNetType myNetwork;</i>
<h2>Things in common</h2>
<p> Each of the network representations have a few things in common.  
Few of the containers have special functions.  The main things are storage and retrieval of
nodes and arcs in the graph.  Similar to STL containers, the complexity
of retrieving one node or one arc depends on the implementation of the graph.   
<p>Node Ids are used to specify distinct nodes.  The default comparison
for nodes is by Node Id.  For Arcs, there is no real default comparison.  
<p>Iterators over nodes and arcs and arcs at a node are available with each collection.  
Also, the complexity of iterating is constant.  (i.e. getting the 'next' is performed in
constant time complexity.
<p>Algorithms can be applied to any of the network implementations without 
knowing the particular
implementation.  There are some times when incompatibilities exist.  
Great care was taken to ensure that a StaticNet did not pay penalties on 
complexity just to fit the interface with a DynNet.  But, even though
the interface is the same, care must still be taken.  The StaticNet 
must be created in a particular order.   If the order is wrong, the Static
Net will not load properly.  
<h2> Network Container classifications</h2>
<p>Performance in many conditions was a primary concern in the design.  
The StaticNet is really fast.  However, it cannot be resized after load
time.  The DynNet is fairly fast as well, but some operations are not
as quick and the memory demand is higher.  Some networks are truly directed 
and there is no purpose in having back-pointers.  However, there is a need
in some cases to be able to traverse both directions along an arc, 
regardless of whether it is directed or undirected.  These needs motivated
the creation of two classifications of Networks:  One classification is
based on Static versus Dynamic.  The other is based on single versus both
directions stored on an arc.
<h3>Static Network vs Dynamic Network</h3>
<p> The Static Network was born out of the need for a very fast network 
implementation.  Essentially, it is a Forward Star representation where 
the nodes and arcs are both stored in STL vectors.  The complexity for
getting a node given a NodeId is constant.  This is important in some
algorithms.  However, this quickness is paid for in the lack of ability
to delete arcs or to add arcs even in a non-standard order.  If you are 
willing to pay the price of careful construction and post-load dynamic
behavior, StaticNet is the network representation for the greatest speed.
<p>The Dynamic Network (DynNet) allows for creation and deletion of arcs 
and nodes.  You can freely create and destroy nodes randomly.  However, 
this freedom comes at a price.  The complexity for lookup of a Node given
a Node Id is O(log(|V|)).  where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.  
Also, there is a higher space requirement.  Although it is a constant 
factor based on the size of the graph, it may still be much larger than 
the StaticNet for large graphs.

<h1>Network Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Shortest Path (DijkSolver, LayerSPSolver)</h2>
<P>The shortest path algorithm implementation mostly follows the original
Dijkstra style.  It is based on that strategy.  It uses a heap to hold
potentially 'active' nodes.  There is a label at each node.  The particular
implmentation was inspired by an algorithm in "Network Flows" book by 
Ahuja, Mangnanti, and Orlin. 
<P>The Shortest Path Problem is the problem of finding the minimum 
"sum of weights" path through a network with weights on each arc.  There
is a distinct source and the solver finds minimum cost paths to all other
nodes.  They are extracted from the solver object using a collection of
Path objects. (In rough terms Path object is a collection of Node Ids + 
a cost.)
<P>The Layered Shortest Path solver solves a variant of this problem.
<BR><A HREF="ShortestPath.html">ShortestPath</A> <BR>
<h2>Minimum Cost Spanning Tree (MSTSolver)</h2>
<P>The Minimum Cost Spanning Tree Problem involves finding the minimum
cost collection of arcs such that all nodes are connected into a tree.  Note 
that this requires an undirected graph (in examples, I chose a StaticFBNet).
<BR><A HREF="MinCostSpan.html">MinCostSpan</A> <BR>
<h2>Exhaustive Depth First Traversal (DFTraversal)</h2>
<P>There are several ways to traverse a graph.  This is an exhaustive Depth
first search into the graph.  It uses recursion.  
<P> Note that this implementation is exhaustive in that it doesn't stop if 
a node has previously been visited.  If the graph has cycles, this will be
an infinite loop!  
<P>It is implemented in the form of an iterator.  Each time the iterator is 
incremented (++), the object moves on to the next node in the sequence.  
It could be extended to be non-repeating if data is added at the nodes that
indicate the node has previously been visited. 
<BR><A HREF="Traversals.html">Traversals</A> <BR>
<h2>Exhaustive Breadth First Traversal (BFTraversal)</h2>
<P>Similar to DFS, but uses a queue as storage of active nodes.  This can be
fairly painful in terms of storage....so beware.
<BR><A HREF="Traversals.html">Traversals</A> <BR>
<h2>All Paths between source and sink (PathFind)</h2>
This exhaustive algorithm is similar to DFS, except it stores all paths that
happen to run into the sink.  more details can be viewed at:
<BR><A HREF="PathFind.html">PathFind</A> <BR>
An example is the PathFindExample.cpp example code.
<h1>Some Sample Code:</h1>
<h2>Simple</h2>
Simple construction of a graph with just a few nodes and arcs.
<h2>SimpleShortestPath</h2>
This is a simple example that tests the network as well as the simple 
algorithm to solve the Shortest Path problem in a directed acyclic network.
<h2>PathFindExample</h2>
This is a little more complex, but not overwhelming.  There are 3 main points to this example:
@li Demonstrate the use of the PathFind algorithm
@li Demonstrate having "empty data" on the graph thus reducing ram consumption
@li Demonstrate the use of a DynNet and a destructive example of removing a node on the fly
<h2>SSPSolver</h2>
This is a comprehensive example showing much more complex usage of the graph
@li more complex data storage on nodes
@li more complex data storea on arcs
@li implements a well known algorithm for solving min cost network flow problems (Successive Shortest Paths)  There is a reference in the code to the source of the algorithm.
